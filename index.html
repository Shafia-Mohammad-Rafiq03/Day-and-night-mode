            <p>Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.</p>
              <br>
            <p>When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You think:<br>
                <br>
                “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have already<br>
                <br>
                used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too.<br>
                <br>
                So learning closures is less about understanding a new concept and more <br>
                <br>
                 recognizing something you have already been doing for a while.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">You have a closure when <b>a function accesses variables defined outside of it.</b></p>
              <br>
            <p>For example, this code snippet contains a closure:</p>
              <div class="js">
                <span class="blue">let</span> <span>users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica'];</span><br>
                <br>
                <span class="blue">let </span> <span>query = 'A';</span><br>
                <br>
                <span class="blue"> let</span> <span> user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));</span>
            
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Notice how user => user.startsWith(query) is itself a function. It uses the query variable. But the query <br>
                <br> 
                variable is defined outside of that function. That’s a closure.
            </p>

            <p class="bold"><b>You can stop reading here, if you want.</b>The rest of this article approaches closures ,<br>
            <br>
            in a different way. Instead of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through the <br>
            <br>
             process of discovering closures — like the first programmers did in the 1960s.

        <h3><a href="#">Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</a></h3>


        <p>To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables and <br> functions. In this example, we declare the food variable inside the eat function:</p>


        <p>But what if we wanted to later change the food variable outside of the eat <br> function? To do this, we can move the food variable itself out of our function into <br> the top level:</p>

        <p>This lets us change the food “from the outside” any time that we want to:</p>
